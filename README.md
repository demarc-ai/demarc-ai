## What is the DeMarc Method?

The **DeMarc Method** is a psychology-driven framework for AI collaboration that adapts to your thinking style. Instead of memorizing prompts, you build a productive partnership with AI through:

1. **Dynamic Engagement**: Tailor interactions based on real-time feedback
2. **Mode Selection**: Choose the AI's operating mode to match your task (Ideation, Execution, Refinement)
3. **Mutual Understanding**: Develop a shared context through iterative exchanges
4. **Adaptive Mastery**: Evolve your techniques as you learn from AI responses
5. **Results Optimization**: Fine-tune outputs for precision and relevance
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Incorporate performance data to refine future collaborations

> While the DeMarc Method is in its early stages, it represents our vision for transforming AI prompt engineering into a sustainable, psychology-informed practice.
